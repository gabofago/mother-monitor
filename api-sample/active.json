It&#039;s an extreme case of a carousel rider who, in spite of her past, still genuinely considers herself a good person and marriage material. I broke it down almost point by point.  A. The winner of Best Anal Scene doesn&#039;t want to be called a slut.  B. Her &quot;transition into the mainstream world&quot; included a stint as one of Charlie Sheen&#039;s fuck toys. So, exactly how much respect is that supposed to earn a girl? C. She refers to her image as something &quot;created out there for me&quot; - she&#039;s not accepting any responsibility. D. She thinks she could make $20k in a WEEK! That was the money she got the week after she blabbed about Sheen. Today, she&#039;s almost 30 and clearly beat - she&#039;d be lucky to make $500 a scene. E. People treat you like you&#039;d be damaging to children because drug addled whores are, in fact, damaging to children.  F. She wishes people would treat her the same way they treat a respectable, good wife and mother. She&#039;s basically saying that she wishes there were no consequences to being a whore...it should be a noble profession. G. Other girls, don&#039;t do porn because evil, closed-minded people will judge you for it. THEY&#039;RE the bad people, not the drugged-out whores taking miles of dick to pay for a continuous party. H. It&#039;s time for people to respect whores. There you have it. All of society - all of reality - has to change so that her bad decisions have no consequences."

They should honor their own race and propagate their own blood line. Nothing good can come of mixing. Only degeneracy and subversiveness. It is a sin to our forefathers. I can honestly say I&#039;ve never felt better. I am sick of seeing this country be overrun by foreigners.

He was not guilty of Genocide and yet somehow guilty of Genocide in Srebrenica.  What is the definition of Genocide? Isn&#039;t Genocide &quot;the intent to systematically eliminate a cultural, ethnic, linguistic, national, racial or religious group.&quot; Srebrenice, if the numbers are true, would in this case be more close to ethnic cleansing, for Ethnic cleansing is the systematic forced removal of ethnic or religious groups from a given territory by a more powerful ethnic group, with the intent of making it ethnically homogeneous. He was guilty i cite of &quot; five counts of crimes against humanity and four of war crimes, including taking UN peacekeepers hostage, deporting civilians, murder and attacks on combatants. &quot; So what are the most important proofs of those charges and has anyone got some links, audios, testimonies which of those most important proofs - of that he has done or order such things? Is there link where I could see those? Cheers"

I think he initially ran as a publicity stunt, but more and more I believe that he&#039;s attempting to become the man he presents to the public. Cruz - A lecherous liar who may even believe himself a figure of religious significance. I think this guy does a lot of mental gymnastics to reconcile his day-to-day political intriguing with his Christian zealotry. Kasich - I think he&#039;s a power-hungry neocon, but I feel as if there are some lines he wouldn&#039;t cross. He doesn&#039;t seem innately malicious. Yeb (I realize he&#039;s not in the race, but he&#039;s still an interesting figure) - Always the lesser brother, eclipsed by George Jr. and scorned by George Sr. I think Jeb really wasn&#039;t made for politics, and in a lot of ways he reminds me of Louis XVI. Really dodged a bullet not electing him. Clinton - Duplicitous, malevolent, controlling and extremely power-hungry. I believe there is no line Clinton will not cross; no criminal act she would not approve if it meant securing her the presidency Sanders - I believe he&#039;s a genuinely nice person who honestly believes his solutions are the right ones. I just think, for whatever reason, he refuses to see that his policies are unfeasible and would never be passed were he to somehow win the election"
