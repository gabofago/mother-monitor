To me it seems everyone accepts evolution, but when it comes to intelligence people will call you racist for suggesting evolution has something to do with intelligence. I think that&#039;s just crazy. A brain doesn&#039;t simply pop into existence one day. It has to be evolved trough natural selection. I drew a shitty simplified view of what I think about race and intelligence. Is this wrong? If it&#039;s wrong I want to see some proof. There are a lot of people on /pol/ who actually believe that black people are just as smart as white people and their lack of intelligence is the fault of society and poverty."
