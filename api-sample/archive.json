So my question: Do non-whites think people whiter than them are &quot;better&quot; then them? Purely based on skincolor? (Racist btw) It seems like non-whites do this but maybe this is because I&#039;m on /pol/ and am too much exposed to these opinions. It really seems like blacks judge other blacks with a lighter skintone as inherently better (racist as fuck). To paint a clearer picture, here is the other side of the coin: We whites judge each other based on others character and actions. This makes it so someone who works harder most likely will end up being promoted compared to another white dude who is slacking off who most likely won&#039;t get promoted or get fired. Another quirky result of this is that a white nerdy dude with acne but with confidence can actually be &quot;cooler&quot; and more popular than a handsome but shy (insecure) dude....an unpolular view on /pol/ I know but real life proves otherwise. Honest thoughts of non-whites are most welcome here. (Canada isn&#039;t, Australia is)"
