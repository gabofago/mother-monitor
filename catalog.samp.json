We breed them out to other animals all the time, do animals have consent to do so?  You might instead say we don&#039;t care because we as a society find it abhorrent. But denying a human basic sexual rights to self-autonomy with non-consenting objects is accepted. It&#039;s not liked, but it&#039;s accepted. We don&#039;t legally care if someone masturbates with a tool. And we&#039;ve made the &#039;it&#039;s an abomination&#039; with homosexuality, and that&#039;s with two consenting people. We force animals to mate against their will. We kill animals for food and material and sometimes just because we can. We control their lives in every facet. And yet we forbid ourselves sexual congress with them because of faulty logic. There is no reasonable legal case against a man wanting to fuck an animal."

    "teaser": "A gender-fluid high school student was bullied on social media after a picture of her using the boys bathroom was tweeted by another student. Elliot Cope attends Timber Creek High School in Keller ISD. She and her friends say they hope the incident will spark the kind of change they’ve been looking for. Cope says she was trying to wash clay off her hands after a class on Wednesday, and had no idea someone snapped a photo behind her. That photo was tweeted out, and then retweeted several times. Tweets included captions like “walk in the boy restroom and…” another said “ma’am are you lost?” Cope is biologically female, but identifies as gender neutral. &quot;I&#039;m non binary transgender so I don&#039;t identify as male or female I&#039;m kind of both but I&#039;m just neither,” said Cope. She says she was called into the principal’s office and told she was not supposed to be in there. She says she also began receiving support on social media. Keller ISD released a statement that said in part &quot;when students request special accommodations related to gender identity, campus administrators work with each individual to develop a plan that best suits the student’s needs as well as those of the entire student body&quot;. Cope says she was given permission to use the non-gender specific faculty bathrooms, but that plan isn’t working out in her opinion. https://archive.is/czukE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJGd7loGrSI"

    "teaser": "holy shit, /pol/ you got to read this transcript of an interview between Playboy Magazine and Michael Savage. he is more angry, miserable, and red-pilled than he lets on in his show. &gt;PLAYBOY: A little. You definitely sound angry. &gt;SAVAGE: Well, I get worked up. First of all, I get angry because I can’t believe I live in a country that’s so fucking stupid it lets every group in the world come here. “Please let us in because our country is a shit hole.” Fine! “Let us come in on asylum because our country will kill us.” No problem! Then the minute they fucking get here they turn around and sue the fucking country, make demands on the country, won’t learn the language, won’t salute the flag, and all they do is disparage the country. &gt;[...]SAVAGE: We should consider what’s being taught in any house of worship. I don’t know of a church or synagogue in America that teaches people to go out and kill anybody or to go back to the homeland and learn how to strap a bomb on their dick and blow it up on an airplane.  &gt;[...] PLAYBOY: You were fired from MSNBC after telling an anonymous gay caller to “eat a sausage and choke on it” and “get AIDS and die.” [...] &gt;PLAYBOY: But given your stance on gay politics, do you understand why that photograph would be confusing now? &gt;SAVAGE: [Angrily] What does it mean? You hang around with a gay man, you’re gay? I mean, what are they, nuts? Don’t you see the hate that comes out of people when they try to pervert this? Who the fuck would sleep with Ginsberg even if they were gay? He was a horrendous man, horrible. An old, fucking disgusting queen. Communist NAMBLA [North American Man/Boy Love Association] member. There were a lot of reasons to not like the man, and he wasn’t my friend. https://emptysuit.wordpress.com/2010/05/25/michael-savage-playboy-interview-transcript/"

Meanwhile there are quite some people who just do not like Hofer, so even though 60% of the population thinks Van der Bellen is an idiot, they would still not vote for Hofer in the Stichwahl. If I vote Hofer, and he gets the second place and loses against Van der Bellen in der Stichwahl, I will have voted for disaster.
